Links/URLs to any videos you created and want to submit as part of your report.
None, all images included in the [report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DCq7ug_FsmJ6Gifv6wAIpV3Zud9a16wJObrEB0jpyB0/edit#) 

What operating system and IDE you used to run and compile your code.

I used Xcode to program this project.

Instructions for running your executables.

I used a main function located in the vidDisplay file. 

Instructions for testing any extensions you completed.

Please note that image display and vidDisplay are in separate folders as they both have a main function. You will have to test these separately. I recommend running this (Display Video) program in Xcode. One the main file is run and the video is up, you can test all functions via the following commands:

   q = quit
   a = normal (toggle back and forth)
   g = grayscale
   h = custom grayscale
   x = sobelX
   y = sobelY
   m = magnitude
   l = blurquantize
   c = cartoon
   r = rainbow sparkles
   s = save image
   
   Extensions:
   w = widescreen cinema
   f = old film
   j = laplacian
   z = face detect 

Whether you are using any time travel days, and how many.

2 time travel days used.
